What is lie angle?,"It's the angle that the clubhead sits on the ground."
Is there a standard lie angle?,"There isn't an industry standard. It varies by club manufacturer. Each company will have a specification chart for each line of clubs with their length and lie angle."
Are all brands of irons the same length?,"Similar to lie angle, it varies by club manufacturer. Each company will have a specification chart for each line of clubs with their length and lie angle."
What is attack angle?,"It is the up or down movement of the club at the time of maximimum compression."
What is smash factor?,"Smash factor is calculated by dividing the ball speed by the clubhead speed of a golfer. It's a measurement of effeciency in the swing. An ideal smash factor with a driver is 1.50"
What is hard stepping?,"Hard stepping is installing a shorter iron shaft in a longer iron. The goal is for it to play stiffer at the tip to reduce spin and launch angle."
What is soft stepping?,"Soft stepping is installing a longer iron shaft in a short iron. The goal is for it to play softer at the tip to increase launch angle and get a higher trajectory."
What is the average clubhead speed of a PGA Tour pro?,"The average PGA Tour pro's driver clubhead speed is 113 MPH, and 92 MPH with a 6 iron. You can see some of their other average clubhead data here https://blog.trackmangolf.com/trackman-average-tour-stats/"
What should be my launch angle with my driver?,"Optimal launch angle will vary depending on the ball speed of the individual. Ideally we would have a positive angle of attack with minimal spin to optimize our carry. Consult the following chart to determine your ideal launch based on your ballspeed - https://ping.com/en-us/blogs/proving-grounds/optimal-launch-and-spin."
How do I know what my lie angle should be?,"Lie angle varies greatly by individual. A good rule of thumb however is if you're hitting the ball on the toe and your ball is moving too far right then you need a more upright lie angle. If you're htting the ball off the heel and the ball is moving too far left, then your lie is too upright and needs to be flatter."
What are the different flexes of shafts?,"Shafts vary in flex, but the usual catgories in order of stiffness are extra stiff, stiff, regular, senior/a flex/soft regular, and ladies flex. Some shaft manufacturers also offer Tour Extra Stiff and Stiff+."
How do I know what shaft flex I need?,"The flex of your shaft would depend mainly on your clubhead speed and tempo. With a driver the ranges would be: >105 MPH = Extra Stiff, 97-104 MPH = Stiff, 84-96 MPH = Regular, 72-83 MPH = Senior, <71 = Ladies."
How long should my golf clubs be?,"To find the ideal height we would use a combination of height and wrist-to-floor measurement. You can find a general chart at https://swingfit.net/golf-clubs-vs-height/ that is a good starting point." 
What irons should I play?,”The irons we play vary greatly. It depends on our ball striking ability, handicap and feel. Usually high handicappers will play Game Improvement Irons, mid handicappers can play Players Distance irons, and lower handicappers can play a players iron or blades”
How do I get my driver spin down?,”First you would take a look at the loft you’re playing. Too much loft can cause more spin. Another option is to go with a stiffer/lower spinning shaft. If that doesn’t work there’s options for tipping a shift to make it play stiffer and reduce spin. Lastly I would look at a lower spinning driver head. Many brands offer a low spin head for golfers with high clubhead speed and/or high spin numbers”
What is swing weight?,”Swing weight is a measurement of a golf club's balance point, or how heavy it feels when you swing it. The average swing weight of a full-swing golf club off the rack ranges from C8-D5.”
What’s the difference between stock and aftermarket shafts?,”aftermarket shafts are made from more premium materials and have a tighter tolerance. They generally offer benefits such as better feel, more consistent performance compared to stock shafts”
What is torque?,”It’s the shafts resistance to twisting. It is measured in degrees. A lower torque shaft will twist less and could feel stiffer as compared to a shaft with higher torque.”
What is kickpoint?,”It is the area of the shaft that will bend the most during the swing. A low kick point is towards the head of the club, mid kick point near center and high kickpoint near the grip.”
What is shaft lean?,”Shaft lean is the angle of the club shaft at impact. Ideally we want some forward shaftlean when striking the ball.”
What causes a slice?,”A slice is caused by making impact with a ball when the clubface is open to the path.”
What causes a hook?,”A hook is caused by making impact with a ball when the face is closed to the path.”
What is gear effect?,”Gear effect is the term used to explain how and why hitting the ball off-centre changes the ball flight. When the ball makes contact with the heel and toe it will cause the club face to change the direction it was pointing and will affect the spin, the ball will turn towards the Center of Gravity.”
What does it mean to tip a shaft?,"Shaft tipping is when a club builder removes length from the tip section of a shaft, which is the end where the clubhead is installed. In most cases, tip trimming a shaft makes it meaningfully stiffer. It also increases torsional stiffness, known as “torque,” which is a shaft’s resistance to twisting."
Does the grip matter?,"Grip is all about personal prefernce and comfort. We want to make sure that it's the right size for how we grip the club and that the texture is comfortable for us."
How high should I hit the ball?,"This could vary widely depending on the clubhead speed, ball speed and type of shot we're playing. But on average the professionals hit all of there clubs about the same height around 31 yards in the air." 
What are optimal spin numbers?,"These could vary greatly depending on our clubhead speed and ball speed but a good rule of thumb is to aim for around 1000 RPM times the iron we are hitting. So 7,000 RPM for a 7 iron, 8,000 for an 8, etc."
What’s the advantage of adjustable hosels on clubs?,"The golfer is able to customize their lie angle and loft to improve their ball flight."
How much should my clubs be gapped?,"Most gaps in lofts between clubs is around 4 to 5 degrees to promote around a 10-15 yard gap between the clubs."
Can I have my clubs bent if the lie angle is wrong?,"Yes most clubs can be bent. Forged clubs can be bent around 3-4 degrees and cast clubs could be bent around 1-2 degrees."
Can I have my clubs bent to add or subtract loft?,"Yes you can. This is done often for players who want to change the gaps in their yardages. You can bend the clubs stronger which means less loft to hit the ball further. And the reverse would be to bend them weaker to hit the ball shorter and usually increase spin."
