Welcome to the AI Assisted club fitter. This project aims to use Langchain and Google Gemini to create an RAG application to help golfers who have questions about golf equipment and club fitting. 

If you want to fork and run the project feel free. To run the project:
1. Download the requirements.txt to your local machine or I would suggest a virtual machine.
2. Check to make sure the dependencies downloaded.
3. From the command line run the command "streamlit run main.py"

The project is hosted by the Streamlit Community Cloud and can be viewed at the url: club-fitter.streamlit.app
